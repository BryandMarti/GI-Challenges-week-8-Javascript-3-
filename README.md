GI Challenges week 8 Javascript


I focused on understanding constructors, which are vital for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. I explored tutorials, documentation, and hands-on coding exercises to learn. Initially, constructors seemed complex, but as I dug deeper, I began to understand their usefulness. I experimented with different constructor patterns, like the older prototype-based approach and the newer ES6 class syntax. Each experiment taught me something new and helped me better grasp object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
